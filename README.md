# The 1900s #

The 1900s are a block of extensions on [tilde.tel](https://tilde.tel "tilde.tel") for subscribers to hack on, anyone can contribute whatever they'd like, the only caveat being that it can't infringe on any other ~tel user's good time so no Happy Dude antics.

* Pick whatever extension you like within the 1901-1999 block
* Add whatever you like to `extensions-1900s.conf` (it should be in the newer 1.8 extn/same format)
* Add any sound files to `/sounds/[extension]`
* Add any scripts or additional required files to `/etc/[extension]`

Yell out if you need anything else. Let's party.
